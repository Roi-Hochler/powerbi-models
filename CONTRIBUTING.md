```

By default the tests run using PhantomJS

There are various command line arguments that can be passed to the test command to facilitate debugging:

Run tests with Chrome

```bash
npm test -- --chrome
```

Enable  debug level logging for karma, and remove code coverage

```bash
npm test -- --debug
```

Disable single run to remain open for debugging

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

These are often combined and typical command for debugging tests is:

```bash
npm test -- --chrome --debug --watch
```
